Functional programming

Recall functions learned in high school

f(x)

dy/dx

d(x^2)/dx = 2x
The derivation function takes in a function (x^2) and output 
another function (2x)

In funtional programming, functions are first class citizen.
First class citizen has the following criteria to be met:
1. value of a variable
2. argument to a procedure
3. return value from a procedure
4. member of an aggregate

Functions in functional programming can do all of the above so
they are first class citizen.
